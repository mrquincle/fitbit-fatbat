# Decoding

You might want to install a few tools like `xxd`, `hexdump`, or `hexedit` if you are gonna take more often a look at protocols. In this script I use `xxd` because it is easy to adjust the number of columns.

Observe that the base64 decoding expects new lines! 

The command you find as `example` is from [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/9STG0yus).
