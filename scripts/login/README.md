# Login on Android phone

A bunch of scripts and files to automate logging in on a FitBit on an Android phone.

This only works on a Nexus 4, record your own .txt files for your own device.

Set environmental variables:

    $FITBIT_USERNAME
    $FITBIT_PASSWORD

You can also just type the username/password each time. These scripts are not necessary at all. :-)
