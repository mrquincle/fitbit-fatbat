# BLE capture on Android

There is a simple developer option to capture packages on Android, see for example this [viaforensics](https://viaforensics.com/articles-presentations/bluetooth-packet-capture-android.html) article.

It is in the `Developer options` page, and is called something like `Enable Bluetooth HCI snoop log`.

Afterwards you can get this log using the script here. Just one command you don't need to remember now. :-)
